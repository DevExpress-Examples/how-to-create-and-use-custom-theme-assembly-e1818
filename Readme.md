# [OBSOLETE] How to create and use a custom theme assembly


## This example is dedicated to an obsolete approach. If your DevExpress version is newer than 12.1, we recommend the solution from the [Attaching a Custom Theme Assembly](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/16728/common-concepts/appearance-customization-theming/attaching-a-custom-theme-assembly) article


The project is a **duplicate** of the [How to use a custom theme assembly](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-use-custom-theme-assembly-e1764) repository and is not maintained. If you need to use the old approach, refer to [How to use a custom theme assembly](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-use-custom-theme-assembly-e1764).
